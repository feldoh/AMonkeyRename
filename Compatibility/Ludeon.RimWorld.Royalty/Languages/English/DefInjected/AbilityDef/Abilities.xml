  <AnimaTreeLinking.description>Start the bananima tree linking ceremony. The linking person will meditate near the tree to gain a psylink level. Other psychically-sensitive colonists can also help enhance the psychic link. More participants will accelerate the ceremony and cause some of the bananima grass to re-grow as the ritual completes.</AnimaTreeLinking.description>
